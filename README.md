# food_recipe
Project Description:

I have developed a food recipe project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integration. This project showcases my skills in web development and demonstrates my ability to create interactive and dynamic web applications.

The project allows users to search for various recipes based on their preferences and dietary restrictions. The front-end interface, designed using HTML and CSS, provides an intuitive and visually appealing user experience. Users can browse through a wide range of recipes, view detailed instructions, and even save their favorite recipes for future reference.

The core functionality of the project is implemented using JavaScript, which enables real-time filtering and sorting of recipes based on ingredients, cooking time, and other criteria. The integration of an API allows the project to retrieve and display accurate and up-to-date recipe information from external sources.

Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in working with front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also mastering the implementation of API integration. Additionally, I have honed my problem-solving skills, as I encountered and overcame various challenges during the development process.

Overall, this food recipe project reflects my ability to create functional and visually appealing web applications, showcasing my proficiency in web development and API integration. It demonstrates my dedication to delivering a user-friendly experience and my passion for leveraging technology to enhance everyday activities such as cooking and meal planning.
